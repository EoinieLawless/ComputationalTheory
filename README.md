# Computational Theory
This repository contains materials for the "Computational Theory" module, created by Eoin Lawless as part of the fourth-year assessment.

### Aim

The Jupyter Notebook within this repository is crafted to fulfill several objectives:
- **Identify difficult computational problems**: By analyzing the Countdown Numbers Game, we explore the intricacies of problems that, while seemingly simple, pose significant computational challenges.
- **Define common models of computation**: We discuss foundational computational theory concepts such as P, NP, NP-Complete, and NP-Hard problems, providing a framework for understanding computational limits.
- **Design computer programs using a variety of computational paradigms**: Through the implementation of solutions using Reverse Polish Notation and recursive algorithms, we demonstrate practical applications of different computational paradigms.
- **Analyse the complexity of algorithms**: By examining the efficiency and scalability of the algorithms developed to solve the Countdown Numbers Game, we critically assess the computational complexity and suggest optimizations.

The Jupyter Notebook uses the Countdown Numbers Game as a case study to demonstrate the application of computational theory in analyzing and solving real-world problems. This game, popularized by the TV show "Countdown," involves using six randomly selected numbers and standard arithmetic operations to reach a target number. This problem is used to illustrate:
- **Algorithm Design**: Detailed explanation of algorithmic solutions using both brute force and optimized techniques such as backtracking.
- **Computational Complexity Analysis**: Discussion on the computational complexity involved in the game, including the potential exponential growth of problem-solving operations and strategies to mitigate computational cost.
- **Practical Implementation**: Implementation of algorithms in Python to solve the game, accompanied by analysis of their performance and complexity through empirical data.
- **Analytical Insights**: Insights drawn from real data on the performance of the implemented algorithms, enhancing understanding of theoretical versus practical outcomes in computational tasks.
