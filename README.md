# Computational Theory
This is a repository for my 4th year module - "Computational Theory"
By Eoin Lawless

### Aim 

This Jupyter Notebook is apart of my assesemnt to:

- Identify difficult computational problems in everyday computing
- Define the common models of computation
- Design computer programs using a variety of computational paradigms
- Analyse the complexity of an algorithm

In the Notebook, we use Countdowns Number game, to help show these computational complexity, analyse and design functions to help combat the problems that can be produced from a complex algorithm.
