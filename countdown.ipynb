    "The Countdown Numbers Game is a popular mathematical puzzle that is featured as a segment on the television show \"Countdown.\" The game involves the contestents selecting a set of six numbers from a specified range, typically consisting of small integers (e.g., 1 to 10) and larger integers (e.g., 25, 50, 75, and 100). Once chosen, a random number between 101 and 999 is generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The aim of the game is to use the six selected numbers through basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the randomly generated number. The contestants can only use the selected numbers once, and they have to use all six numbers. Not all the numbers need to be used in the final expression, but they must be used into the in between steps of the calculation. Contestants can use various approaches to reach the target number, but no fractions are allowed during any stage of the calculation and positive numbers are only allowed(In the case of subtaction). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)\">[1]<a></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "*Computational complexity* refers to the study of the resources required for computational problems, resources like as time and space. It is used to solve computational algorithm and understand more efficient ways of problem solving.Time complexity, measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to finish, based on how big the problem is. Space complexity measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires.\n",

    "In computational complexity theory, problems are classified based on their difficulty. Some problems can be solved efficiently and fast, while others may take a long time and unefficient. These can be classified by using the terms P, NP, and NP-complete.\n",
