    "The Countdown Numbers Game is a popular mathematical puzzle that is featured as a segment on the television show \"Countdown.\" The game involves the contestents selecting a set of six numbers from a specified range, typically consisting of small integers (e.g., 1 to 10) and larger integers (e.g., 25, 50, 75, and 100). Once chosen, a random number between 101 and 999 is generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The aim of the game is to use the six selected numbers through basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the randomly generated number. The contestants can only use the selected numbers once, and they have to use all six numbers. Not all the numbers need to be used in the final expression, but they must be used into the in between steps of the calculation. Contestants can use various approaches to reach the target number, but no fractions are allowed during any stage of the calculation and positive numbers are only allowed(In the case of subtaction). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)\">[1]<a></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "*Computational complexity* refers to the study of the resources required for computational problems, resources like as time and space. It is used to solve computational algorithm and understand more efficient ways of problem solving. Time complexity, measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to finish, based on how big the problem is. Space complexity measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational complexity theory, problems are classified based on their difficulty. Some problems can be solved efficiently and fast, while others may take a long time and unefficient. These can be classified by using the terms P, NP, and NP-complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**P Problems**: P problems are efficiently solvable using algorithms with reasonable time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NP Problems**: These are decision problems for which a given solution can be verified in *polynomial time* by a deterministic Turing machine. NP stands for \"nondeterministic polynomial time.\" While solutions to NP problems can be verified quickly, finding the solutions themselves may be difficult and often requires exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NP-Complete Problems**: These are the hardest problems in NP. They are a subset of NP problems for which every other problem in NP can be reduced to in polynomial time. NP-complete problems are considered to be among the most challenging computational problems, as no efficient algorithms are known for solving them.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game involves selecting a set of six numbers and using basic arithmetic operations to reach a target number. The computational complexity of solving this game depends on various factors, including the range of numbers allowed, the target number, and the approach used to find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential Growth**: As the range of numbers allowed and the target number increase, the number of possible combinations and operations grows exponentially. This can lead to a significant increase in the time complexity of finding a solution, especially when using brute-force methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The way we solve the Countdown Numbers Game can affect how long it takes to find an answer. If we try every possible combination of numbers and operations one by one (like checking every door in a house to find the keys), it could take a really long time, especially if there are lots of numbers involved (Which there is). This method is called brute force, and it's not great for big problems because it can take forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NP-Hardness**: While the Countdown Numbers Game may not come directly into the categories of P, NP, or NP-complete problems, its computational complexity shares likeness with NP-hard problems. NP-hard problems are those for which there is no known efficient algorithms, and solving them may require exponential time."
