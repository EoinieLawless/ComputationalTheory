    "\n",
    "The Countdown Numbers Game is a popular mathematical puzzle that is featured as a segment on the television show \"Countdown.\" The game involves the contestents selecting a set of six numbers from a specified range, typically consisting of small integers (e.g., 1 to 10) and larger integers (e.g., 25, 50, 75, and 100). Once chosen, a random number between 101 and 999 is generated.\n",

    "The aim of the game is to use the six selected numbers through basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach the randomly generated number. The contestants can only use the selected numbers once, and they have to use all six numbers. Not all the numbers need to be used in the final expression, but they must be used into the in between steps of the calculation. Contestants can use various approaches to reach the target number, but no fractions are allowed during any stage of the calculation and positive numbers are only allowed(In the case of subtaction). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)\">[1]<a></a>\n",

    "*Computational complexity* refers to the study of the resources required for computational problems, resources like as time and space. It is used to solve computational algorithm and understand more efficient ways of problem solving. Time complexity, measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to finish, based on how big the problem is. Space complexity measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires. <a href=\"  https://www.britannica.com/topic/computational-complexity\">[2]<a></a> \n",

If we try every possible combination of numbers and operations one by one (like checking every door in a house to find the keys), it could take a really long time, especially if there are lots of numbers involved (Which there is).

    "\n",
    "#### **1. Brute Force Approach**\n",
    "- **Description:** This method tests every possible combination of numbers and arithmetic operations until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted. It is the most straightforward approach.\n",
    "- **Complexity:** Easy to implement but becomes impractically slow and computationally expensive as the number of elements increases.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Suitable for problems with a small set of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Optimized Techniques**\n",
    "- **Description:** These algorithms incorporate strategies like backtracking, which eliminates non-viable paths early in the process, reducing unnecessary calculations. They may also use strategic rules to prioritize operations or number choices based on their likelihood to quickly reach the target number.\n",
    "- **Advantages:** Reduces the computational overhead by focusing only on promising paths.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Effective for medium to large-sized datasets where naive approaches fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Practical Efficiency**\n",
    "- **Description:** Balancing algorithmic complexity with practical execution times is critical, especially in timed settings like games. Techniques such as dynamic programming or memoization can significantly enhance performance by storing and reusing previously computed results.\n",
    "- **Benefits:** Significantly reduces execution time and avoids redundant calculations.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Ideal for repetitive calculations or when previous results are useful in subsequent steps.\n",

    "- **Description:** These approaches use heuristics () to approximate solutions more quickly when an exact solution is not crucial. The method guides the search for solutions based on experience or statistical probability rather than exhaustive and exact computation. A heuristic is a practical approach to problem-solving that isn't perfect but is quick and efficient, often used when an exact solution is difficult or impossible to find. It involves using experience, rules of thumb, or educated guesses to find a solution that is good enough for the situation.\n",
    "- **Benefits:** Provides faster solutions by avoiding the need for precise calculations.\n",

    "## How the Code Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Function with RPN Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Exploration**: The function explores all combinations of numbers and operations. It selects a number and an operation, then recalculates what's left. This explores every possible path toward the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RPN Evaluation**: The function uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to evaluate number sequences. RPN makes calculations straightforward because it doesn't need parentheses and processes operations as soon as they're ready, avoiding common mistakes with order of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checking and Updating Closest Results**: If the calculation matches the target number exactly, the search stops with a success. If not, the algorithm updates to keep track of the closest result found. This way, the best possible outcome is always on hand, even if an exact match isn't possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Operations**: The recursive approach, combined with immediate RPN processing, allows the function to stop following paths that won't lead to promising results early. This makes the overall computation faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages Over Just Recursive or Just RPN\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better Together**: Using both recursive methods and RPN balances their strengths. Recursive exploration without RPN might be slow because it needs to evaluate complex expressions after they're fully formed. RPN alone doesn't organize how numbers and operations come together to hit a target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quick Adjustments**: This hybrid method gives immediate feedback about whether the current path is worth following. It cuts down on time wasted on unlikely solutions by stopping early on dead ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptable and Reliable**: The approach adjusts to different sets of numbers and targets, handling each new challenge effectively. It reliably finds the closest possible solution, an edge not guaranteed when using purely recursive or RPN methods.\n"
